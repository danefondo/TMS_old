First implementation of a full CRUD function. The app is capable of adding items to the database, however, it is only capable of retrieving items from the database by ID, hence it is only possible to retrieve one pre-selected ID-linked item at a time. Next goal is to be able to 1) Retrieve ALL items in the database; 2) and then display them.
