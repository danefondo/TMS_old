Same as TMS ver 0.1, except this is a Python Flask based implementation, which requires running the program on a server to use it. The Python app is simple, first the important extensions are imported, then the app is initialized, a route is created, and then come the functions for the app to be run.

In addition, the proper Flask app folder structure is implemented, as well as the HTML is changed to properly link to Flask-Python files.
